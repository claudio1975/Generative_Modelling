6) The distribution of the two target columns:
- ClaimNb: 0 if no claim, else it follows a ~Poisson distribution
- ClaimAmount: 0 if no claim, else positively skewed with ~gamma distribution

7) Core logical relationships:
If ClaimOcc = 0 → ClaimNb = 0 and ClaimAmount = 0
If ClaimOcc = 1 → ClaimNb ≥ 1 and ClaimAmount > 0
ClaimNb ∈ {0,1,2,3,4}
Exposure ∈ (0,1]
VehValue >= 0
ClaimAmount >= 0

8) Exposure as an offset-like driver of frequency:
For similar risk factors, rows with higher Exposure should have proportionally higher probability of ClaimOcc and higher expected ClaimNb.

9) VehAge ↔ VehValue relationship:
VehValue distribution should depend on VehAge with a clear decreasing trend as vehicles get older

10) Driver age effects on frequency:
ClaimOcc probability should vary by DrivAge with higher risk for youngest/young and slightly elevated risk for oldest groups, and lower risk for middle working-age groups

11) VehBody effects on value and severity:
VehBody should be associated with VehValue and modestly with ClaimAmount distribution (heavier tail for larger/specialty vehicles).

12) Severity structure tied to count:
Conditional on ClaimOcc=1, ClaimAmount should have a positive association with ClaimNb at the distribution level.

13) Interaction hints:
Include mild interactions such that the combination of younger drivers and higher-value younger cars has a modestly higher claim propensity.
 
14) generate a csv files and not provide code to build a dataframe
