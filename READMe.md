# Harnessing Conditional Generative Models for Synthetic Non-Life Insurance Premium Data

This work introduces a synthetic non-life premium dataset generated using several Conditional Generative Models. As a benchmark, has been employed a Conditional Gaussian Mixture Model. The validation of generated data followed several steps: data visualization comparison with univariate analisys, PCA and UMAP 
representations between trained data and samples generated. To evaluate the goodness of data generated has been employed in addition to these visual methods, consistecy check of data produced, the statistical Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and predictive modeling as a measure of the generated data's quality followed by the evidence of features importance. For further comparison, has been evaluated advanced Deep Learning architectures: Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs), CVAEs enhanced with a Transformer Decoder, and a Conditional Diffusion Model. The analysis assesses each model’s ability to capture the underlying distributions, preserve complex dependencies, and maintain conditional relationships intrinsic to the premium data. These findings provide insightful directions for enhancing synthetic data generation in insurance, with potential applications in risk modelling, pricing strategies with scarsity of data, and regulatory compliance.
